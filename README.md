# Expenses
Expenses Control build in React

## Repository Objective

Actually, I'm learning about quite contents. As a entry level programmer I Need to save this contents to self query later, by the way, whenever I need to consult, she it's here 

## About Project

With this project it's possible to add a new Expense, with the title, amount and date.
Also it's possible to filter by month and see the graphic with dinamical bars, which show all month's by year and show  wich month's have more expenses.

## Content Learned
This project makes part of an course totally in english, which isn't my native language, so I've learned a little more of english.

In relation to the project contents, I apply some kinda of topics, and I've learned how to pass props between elements, how to pass props by parent element to child element or vice versa
Right below I said a bit more about.

## CHILD TO PARENT COMPONENT (buttom up)
 To pass date from child element to parent element, first we need to create a function it's will responsible 
to capture the datas. But this function must be created in parent component and later have to being passing via props for child element. 
Inside child element we need to pass the datas with we want to inside the function received via props. thereafter the parent component has the data we want 

##  LIFTING STAGED UP
  The patthern is responsible to up data from one  brother element to another. normally, dont's possible to transfer datas using
 this way. For make this, first we need to use the buttom up patthern, to up the data to the parent element,
 thereafter, we can pass the datas to another child element, wich have the same parent
